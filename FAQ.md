# CodexFlow FAQ

## Which ChatGPT account should I use?

Use a ChatGPT account with Apps / Developer Mode access. OpenAI currently lists Developer Mode for Pro, Plus, Business, Enterprise, and Education accounts on web.

Current testing shows free and Go accounts do not expose the app flow needed for CodexFlow.

codexflow does not unlock Developer Mode, unlock models, bypass account limits, or provide account access. It connects to the ChatGPT app surface your account already has.

Account access and model tool support are separate. An eligible account can have Apps / Developer Mode, while a specific model surface may still be unable to call connectors or MCP tools directly. If CodexFlow actions are unavailable in that chat, use another tool-capable ChatGPT surface or the Pro context fallback for that session.

## How is CodexFlow different from generic workspace bridges?

They can look similar at the transport layer because both use a local MCP-style bridge and a workspace root.

codexflow is more focused: it is built around one clear product loop for ChatGPT users:

```text
install -> run codexflow -> paste the copied Server URL -> choose a project per ChatGPT conversation
```

The main differences are:

- CodexFlow is ChatGPT Developer Mode first, not a generic workspace bridge.
- Bash, write/edit, tool mode, Codex session reads, and handoff execution are separate safety controls.
- Durable context is repo-backed through `AGENTS.md` and `.ai-bridge/*`, so important project memory stays reviewable in files.
- The normal workflow emphasizes compact cards, diffs, `show_changes`, smoke tests, and handoff status files.
- CodexFlow keeps a strict boundary: no model proxying, account pooling, third-party Pro site scraping, quota bypassing, or OS sandbox claims.

codexflow connects ChatGPT to a user-approved local repository over MCP. Repository access, command permissions, and change review remain explicit.

## What is the local companion?

The same broker that serves MCP also serves a private, token-protected application
on the local machine. Press `o` in the running terminal or use:

```bash
codexflow app
```

It shows discovered projects, active and recently closed chat routes, content-free
tool activity, connection health, next-launch settings, and the policy active for
the current process. It does not contain a model composer and cannot silently move
an existing ChatGPT conversation to a different project. Project selection remains
owned by that conversation through the CodexFlow project picker.

The activity ledger is process-local and bounded. It stores project, tool name,
outcome, duration, and a non-actionable display fingerprint—not prompts, arguments,
file contents, command output, tokens, or usable MCP transport identifiers.

## What does Repository Analysis understand?

Repository Analysis builds a local repository map from bounded, inspectable evidence:

- project and package manifests
- source/test/config/documentation paths
- common declarations, imports, includes, and internal module relationships
- Git changes and existing project verification scripts

It supports TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Swift, Java, C#, C, and C++ declaration patterns. Unsupported languages still participate in safe inventory and lexical search.

Relationships are labeled `exact`, `strong`, or `inferred`. The repository map does not replace a compiler or language server. CodexFlow does not require a language server, daemon, embedding service, or vector database.

Analysis is process-local and cached by a bounded workspace fingerprint. Direct CodexFlow writes, edits, and patches invalidate that cache. If limits are reached, results say `partial` and retain normal tree/search/read/review fallback behavior.

Set `CODEXFLOW_ANALYSIS=0` to disable this layer while keeping the standard file, search, Git, and review tools available.

Terminal users can inspect the same facts without ChatGPT:

```bash
codexflow inspect --json
codexflow review --json
```

## What is the `codexflow` supertool?

Note: this FAQ follows GitHub `main`. Check the npm badge/version before assuming a `main` feature is in `codexflow@latest`.

`codexflow` is a stable wrapper tool for advanced setups. It accepts:

```json
{ "action": "search", "args": { "query": "needle", "path": "src" } }
```

Call it with `action=list_actions` to see what the current server mode actually allows. It cannot call tools that are hidden by `--tool-mode`, `--no-bash`, or non-workspace write mode.

Use explicit tools such as `read`, `search`, `edit`, `bash`, and `show_changes` for normal work. Use the supertool when ChatGPT connector caching, custom workflows, or stable wrapper-style integrations matter more than separate visible tool descriptors.

## What is the recommended install path?

Install globally once:

```bash
npm install -g @tarunspandit/codexflow
```

Then run one command from anywhere:

```bash
codexflow
```

CodexFlow discovers local Codex project folders automatically and starts the broker and tunnel.

`npx codexflow@latest` still works as a no-install fallback, but the global install is easier for normal users.

## What do I enable in ChatGPT?

Open ChatGPT and go to:

```text
Settings
-> Security and login
-> Developer mode: on
-> Enforce CSP in developer mode: on

Settings
-> Plugins
-> Create
```

When creating the plugin:

```text
Name: CodexFlow
Description: Local workspace bridge for ChatGPT coding
Connection: Server URL
Server URL: paste the URL copied by CodexFlow
Authentication: No Authentication / None
```

The copied Server URL already includes the private CodexFlow token.

## Should CSP stay enabled?

Yes. Keep Enforce CSP in developer mode enabled.

codexflow widgets are built for the CSP-enabled path. They do not need unrestricted network access, external fonts, remote scripts, iframes, or third-party images.

## Does CodexFlow bypass rate limits?

No.

codexflow does not bypass, avoid, increase, pool, resell, or modify ChatGPT, Codex, OpenAI, or third-party model limits. Every request still runs through the user's own ChatGPT session and whatever limits that account has.

The useful part is that Codex and ChatGPT are different product surfaces. If one workflow is unavailable and another product surface you already have access to is still available, CodexFlow lets you work against the same local repo without changing either product's limits.

## Can CodexFlow use GPT-5.5?

Only if your ChatGPT account already exposes that exact model, or a similar stronger model, in the ChatGPT web product surface you are using, and that model surface can call Developer Mode apps.

Some GPT-5.5 Pro or other model surfaces may not expose app actions in a given chat. If CodexFlow actions are unavailable there, CodexFlow cannot make that request reach the local server. CodexFlow does not provide, proxy, resell, or unlock models. It gives compatible ChatGPT sessions local repo tools.

For models that cannot call tools, generate a repo context bundle instead:

```bash
codexflow pro-bundle --root /path/to/repo --copy
```

## What can ChatGPT see through CodexFlow?

ChatGPT can see explicit workspace context exposed by tools:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.ai-bridge` plans and status files
- git status
- git diff
- selected source files
- file tree and search results

It cannot read hidden Codex runtime memory or anything outside the allowed workspace unless you explicitly allow that root.

## What can ChatGPT edit?

In normal coding mode, ChatGPT can write and exact-edit files inside the configured workspace.

Safety defaults block common sensitive paths:

- `.env`
- private keys
- `.git`
- `node_modules`
- generated build/cache folders
- symlink escapes
- paths outside the workspace

Use handoff mode if you want ChatGPT to write a plan only and let Codex execute locally. In handoff mode, generic `write` and `edit` tools are not advertised to ChatGPT.

Use `CODEXFLOW_WRITE_MODE=off` when you want direct `write` and `edit` tools removed from the advertised MCP tool list while still allowing bounded handoff/context files.

## Can CodexFlow bind bash to a specific session id?

codexflow cannot attach to, read, or execute inside a specific Codex app conversation or terminal session.

The MCP `bash` tool runs from the CodexFlow server process you started for the configured workspace. MCP session ids are HTTP transport state between ChatGPT and CodexFlow; they are not Codex conversation ids.

What CodexFlow can do is require a matching local bash session label before it runs shell commands:

```bash
codexflow --bash-session main --require-bash-session
```

Then `bash` calls must include `session_id: "main"`. This helps avoid accidental shell execution in the wrong CodexFlow terminal, but it is not remote control of an existing Codex app chat.

codexflow can list local Codex session ids and titles when you explicitly opt in:

```bash
codexflow --codex-sessions metadata
```

This reads local Codex JSONL history under `~/.codex/sessions` and `~/.codex/archived_sessions` and returns metadata plus `codex resume <session-id>` commands. Use `--codex-sessions read` only if you also want bounded transcript reads. It does not attach to a live Codex app conversation.

If you do not want ChatGPT to trigger shell commands while you work in Codex, start CodexFlow with bash disabled:

```bash
codexflow --no-bash
```

This removes the `bash` MCP tool from the advertised tool list. ChatGPT can still use non-bash CodexFlow tools such as workspace open, read, search, and show_changes. Direct `write`/`edit` are advertised only in workspace write mode.

If you only want ChatGPT to plan and leave execution to Codex or another local agent:

```bash
codexflow --mode handoff --no-bash
```

## Which tunnel should I choose?

Use this rule:

```text
Fast demo:              Cloudflare quick tunnel
Recommended stable URL: ngrok free dev domain
Custom domain:          Cloudflare named tunnel
Tailnet users:           Tailscale Funnel
No public tunnel:       local-only mode, only for clients that can reach localhost
```

Cloudflare quick tunnel URLs change on restart. If you put a quick-mode URL into ChatGPT, you must edit the ChatGPT app Server URL every time you restart the tunnel.

For most users, the better path is a free ngrok dev domain. Create a free ngrok account, find your assigned dev domain under Universal Gateway -> Domains, and save that hostname during `codexflow`.

If you own a domain, use Cloudflare named tunnels and route DNS to a hostname like `codexflow.example.com`.

## Why does ChatGPT show “Something went wrong” when I create a connector?

Usually ChatGPT could not reach the public MCP URL. A generated `trycloudflare.com` URL is not proof that `cloudflared` stayed connected.

Run the connection test:

```bash
codexflow connection-test --root /path/to/repo
```

This keeps `read`, `tree`, `search`, and `load_skill`, but disables file writes,
bash, and tool cards. In ChatGPT, create the development plugin under
`Settings -> Plugins`, paste the complete Server URL, and choose
`No Authentication`.

The terminal output separates the failure boundary:

- No `POST /mcp received`: the request did not reach CodexFlow. Check the ChatGPT
  Plugins page and the tunnel.
- `POST /mcp -> 401`: paste the complete URL, including `codexflow_token`.
- `POST /mcp -> 2xx`: ChatGPT reached CodexFlow and the MCP endpoint responded.

Keep CodexFlow running while testing. A Cloudflare quick-tunnel URL changes on
every restart. If Cloudflare returns `530` / `Error 1033`, check DNS or
proxy-client DNS handling on the machine running `cloudflared`.

ChatGPT now manages development apps under Plugins. The browser error
`Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node'` occurs in the ChatGPT page, before
codexflow can handle an MCP request. Remove or recreate the stale plugin entry
from the Plugins page, then retry with the current URL. CodexFlow cannot repair
that browser-side entry.

## Can I use the same ChatGPT app URL every day?

Yes, if you use a stable hostname.

Recommended simple path:

```bash
codexflow
# choose ngrok
# enter your ngrok free dev domain
```

After that:

```bash
codexflow
```

The same hostname and CodexFlow token are reused for that workspace.

## What if I want to work in two repos at once?

Run one CodexFlow process. Open two ChatGPT conversations and choose a different project in each picker. Both chats share the same broker and tunnel while keeping independent project bindings.

## Where are the current docs?

Use the [CodexFlow website](https://tarunspandit.github.io/codexflow/), the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tarunspandit/codexflow), or the documentation shipped in the npm package.

## Is CodexFlow production safe?

codexflow is a local developer bridge, not an OS sandbox.

Use it with repos you trust. Keep token auth enabled for public tunnels. Keep safe bash on unless you know why you need full bash. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing it through a public tunnel.

## Where are saved settings stored?

codexflow stores local state under `~/.codexflow` by default. On Windows that is usually `C:\Users\<you>\.codexflow`.

Workspace profiles are JSON files saved under:

```text
~/.codexflow/profiles/
```

Current runtime connection files are saved under:

```text
~/.codexflow/runtime/
```

Set `CODEXFLOW_HOME` to move this directory.

Use:

```bash
codexflow settings
codexflow settings list
codexflow settings delete --yes
```

Saved tokens are redacted when profiles are displayed.
